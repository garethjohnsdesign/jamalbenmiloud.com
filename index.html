 text: Wrote the brand book that turns customers into fans.
book-title: If customers aren&#8217;t talking about your brand, you might as well not exist
book-text: In a world where the average customer grows up seeing 170,000 marketing
 messages by their 17th birthday; where 86% of people admit to sharing social media
 content in the bathroom; where 20% of smartphone users have installed adblocking
 browsers because of their loathing of advertising; customers only talk about the
 brands they LOVE. And, if customers aren&#8217;t talking about your brand, you might as
 well not exist
